##############m1.py############### 

normal mesh 64x64, no external forcing
u = CG, P1
theta = CG, P1
Dt = 0.02
Ro_1 = Ro_2 = 1
Re = 100
Pe = 100
temp. of ocean= two bells
atm. temp. = constant field
Ran for hundred time steps and saved every fifth in m1.pvd

Observation: the code ran smoothly and therefore thought of either running for longer times or adding external forcing

##############m2.py###############

normal mesh 64x64, with external forcing
Dt = 0.02
Ran for 1000 time steps and saved every 25th in m2.pvd
results also stored as pvsm file in ./results/m2.pvsm
FE spaces same as m1.py
Ro_1 = 1
Ro_2 = 10
Re = 1000
Pe = 100
temp. of ocean = one bell
atm. temp. = constant field
f_ext = [-y(y-1)sin(8*pi*x), -sin(8*pi*x)*sin(8*pi*y)]

Observation: nothing much happens after inital few time steps. flow looks wierd. video saved in ./videos/m2.avi

##############m3.py###############

normal mesh 64x64, with external forcing
Dt = 0.02
Ran for 1000 time steps and saved every 25th in m3.pvd
results also stored as pvsm file in ./results/m3.pvsm
FE spaces same as m2.py
Ro_1 = 10**2
Ro_2 = 10**3
Re = 10**5
Pe = 10**2
temp. of ocean = two bells
atm. temp. = constant field
no external forcing
inital vel corresponding to Wei's initial vorticity 

Observation: I see some ripples in atm. velocity field. Doesn't seem natural. results stored as m3.pvsm file and a video ./videos/m3.avi

##############m4.py###############

normal mesh 64x64, with external forcing
Dt = 0.02
Ran for 4000 time steps and saved every 25th in m2.pvd
results also stored as pvsm file in ./results/m2.pvsm
FE spaces same as m2.py
Ro_1 = 10**3
Ro_2 = 10**3
Re = 10**4
Pe = 10**2
temp. of ocean = one bell
atm. temp. = constant field
f_ext = velocity field correponding of Wei's initial condition
initial vel = 0

Observation: The flow looks promising. Maybe can reduce time step or reduce grid size. 
              results stored as m4.pvsm file and a video ./videos/m4.avi

##############m5.py###############
Ro_1 = 10**5
Ro_2 = 10**3
Re = 10**5
Pe = 10**2
The solution diverged at t=5.5. Maybe because Reynolds no. is high !
Reducing the Dt from 0.02 to 0.01 did not change the outcome. The solution
still diverged at t = 5.5
Results saved in ./results/m5.pvsm

##############m6.py###############
#################
Part 1:
Since the solution diverged fro m5.py i used finer grid this time (128x128 Dt = 0.01)
This time the simulation ran for longer time but ultimatly diverged at t = 11.5.
Details:
Ro_1 = 10**5, Ro_2 = 10**3, Re = 10**5, Pe = 10**2
grid = 128x128, Dt = 0.01
Videos saved as ./video/128x128_Re_1e5_Ro1_1e5_f_wei_diverged.avi
#################
Part 2:
I observed that i can increase the Dt for 128x128 grid or in general for other grids since 
this is not a factor for divergence.
Details:
Ro_1 = 10**4, Ro_2 = 10**3, Re = 10**4, Pe = 10**2
grid = 128x128, Dt = 0.02
I stopped the simulation after some time since i wasn't seeing anything interesting.
saved the files as ./results/m6.pvd and also in ./results/m6.pvsm
Observations: the flow still doesn't look as if it has multiple scale processes going on.
              I need to search for f_ext or maybe ocean temperature which may lead to that.

##############m7.py###############
parameters kept same as m4.py with one change. Removed the diffusion term from temperature. 
Also ran the test for 2000 time steps.
Observations: 
The temperature field looks different than m4.py case. 
Results saved in ./results/m7.pvd and m7.pvsm files.

#############compatible_1.py########
I have rewritten the weak formulation so as to implement compatible finite element spaces

normal mesh 64x64, with external forcing
Dt = 0.02
Ran for 4000 time steps and saved every 25th in m2.pvd
results also stored as pvsm file in ./results/c1.pvsm
FE spaces: u is in BDM_1 and temp. is in CG_2
Ro_1 = 10**3
Ro_2 = 10**3
Re = 10**4
Pe = 10**2
temp. of ocean = one bell
atm. temp. = constant field
f_ext = velocity field correponding of Wei's initial condition
initial vel = 0

Observations: The simulation was running fine. I compared the results with
m4.py and they seem to match except only the max. velocity values. The flow looks similar.
I stopped the simulation at t = 6.0.
The results are stored in ./results/c1.pvd file.
The running time for 25 time-steps (1 big t_step) is 1.11 minutes which i think is very high.
The initial temp. for the atmosphere looked weird. Think how to fix that !
